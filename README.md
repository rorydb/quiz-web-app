#quiz-web-app#
An attempt to expand my horizons beyond working on eCommerce websites and working with a ASP.NET MVC as I did in my work environment.

This is a web app in which users can create quizzes which can be taken. Local storage is utilized to store quiz scores and quiz data.

Layout is done using Bootstrap.

All functionality is done my me, using a mix of vanilla JS and jQuery.
